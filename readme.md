This is my Andela Ruby Project

## Notes Application
This is a simple note application that can instantiate a new author for a particular note collection and can also switch author to create a note with the command line interface

It 
  1. stores notes
  2. can read notes 
  3. can edit notes
  4. can delete notes
  5. search notes by a letter or word within the content
  6. list all the notes

## Interactive command line interface
It also features a cmd interface for interactivity.
To use the command line interface run `ruby notes.rb` 
  
  
### Test
The test are done using RSpec
to run the tests `rspec src/notes_test.rb`
